# Commonwealth_Bank__Introduction-To-Data-Scienc
Recently I Participated in the open access Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Data Science virtual experience program with Forage.

Project Overview: 
Task 1 : Data Aggregation and Analysis
Task 2 : Data Anonymisation
Task 3 : Propose Data Analysis Approaches
Task 4 : Designing a Database

I worked on a project to create a data engineering pipeline to aggregate and extract insights from a data set. I practiced using Microsoft Excel and built my data analysis skills in a real-world context.

In this simulation, I learn how to aggregate and analyse data, anonymise personal data, explore data insights with social media, and design a database.Â
